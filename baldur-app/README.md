# Autonomous Debris Detection and Removal System üöúüîç

## Overview

During crop harvesting, debris such as rocks, branches, and metal objects can cause severe damage to farming equipment, leading to costly repairs and delays.
This project aims to provide an autonomous, AI-powered solution to detect and remove debris from fields using a Raspberry Pi-controlled vehicle equipped with a robotic claw.

## Features

‚úÖ Debris Identification ‚Äì Uses sensors and cameras to differentiate between crops and various debris types.

‚úÖ Autonomous Navigation ‚Äì The vehicle moves through the field, scanning and locating obstacles in real time.

‚úÖ Robotic Claw Mechanism ‚Äì The vehicle moves toward the debris, using a robotic arm to pick it up, then removes it from designated areas.

‚úÖ User-Controlled App ‚Äì Farmers can monitor and adjust operations via an easy-to-use mobile application.
